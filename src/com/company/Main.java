	// Create a new IntelliJ project named InheritShape, and set up your project as a Git repository. Be sure to commit your code periodically as you work.
        //2. Create a class named Shape. Shape should have (2) properties: color (a String) and filled (a boolean).
        // Shape should also have a constructor which accepts arguments for both the color & filled properties.
        // Shape should have a method named printShape() which prints out the Shape's details (its color and whether or not it is filled).
        //3. Create a class named Circle which inherits from Shape.
        // Circle should have (1) property (in addition to the 2 it inherits from Shape): radius (a double).
        // Circle should have a constructor which sets all of its properties, using super() to set its inherited properties.
        // Circle should also have (2) methods: getArea() which returns the Circle's area, and getPerimeter() which returns the Circle's perimeter.
        // Circle should override Shape's printShape() method and should print out a Circle's color, whether or not it is filled, its perimeter and its area.
        //HINT: You will need to use Math.PI to calculate the area & perimeter of your Circle.
        //4. Create a class named Rectangle, which inherits from Shape.
        // Rectangle should have (2) properties (in addition to the 2 it inherits from Shape): width (a double) and length (a double).
        // Rectangle should have a constructor which sets all of its properties, using super() to set its inherited properties
        // Rectangle should also have (2) methods: getArea() which returns the Rectangle's area, and get Perimeter() which returns the Rectangle's perimeter.
        // Rectangle should override Shape's printShape() method and should print out a Rectangle's color, whether or not it is filled, its perimeter and its area.
